task 3:
When the code is registered in JAVA after your code is compiled you can run your program on any computer that has a java virtual machine, regardless of the operating system in which you developed and tested the code, as opposed to other programming languages, - Then it depends on the operating system in which you fold it.
But there can be two things in my opinion that can prevent Java code from being independent of the operating system:
1. Special libraries that might use something of a particular operating system.
2. Paths - I'm pretty sure there's a segment with the direction of the slash / or \ (one in Windows and the other in Linux).
